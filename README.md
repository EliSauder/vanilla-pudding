# Vanilla Pudding

A vanilla+ modpack that aims to keep the core experiences of minecraft untouched
while adding fun additions and depth to existing mechanics. I wanted to make a
pack that was fun to play with enough features to keep people who have played
lots of the game engaged, but not so much that it starts to feel like a
different game. There is also some influence of the cottage core style in the
pack which I feel fits decently well with the Minecraft asthetic.

### Philosphy
Where I can, I want to improve what minecraft already 
offers, only if that doesn't work do we look elsewhere. When adding mods the 
goal is to get them to fill in a gap that doesn't already get solved in some 
way by a vanilla feature. Probably the most contentions example of this is the
decision to work on the vanilla recipe book rather than adding JEI 
(or equivelant). If that turns you off from the pack I encourage you to add it
yourself, however, I feel it strays to far from vanilla and removes part of the
fun of discovery.

## Features
- *Immersion* improvements through seasons and dynamically weathering environments.
- *Terrain* generation has been improved in all dimentions.
- *Fishing* improvements that allow it to be used for more than just fish (also 
  the nether now has some fun related things to discover ;) )
- *Farming* has gotten some love with crop additions, qol improvements, and
  improved rewards for doing your farming so you can fulfill your cottage core
  farming dreams.
- *Vanilla Feature Improvements* Many small/large improvements to vanilla 
  features to make them more useful and rewarding.
- *Mapping* got an upgrade with map atlas which simplifies the filling of maps
  while also giving a vanilla integrated minimap feature.
- *Automation* is also covered with Create for all of you that just want to see
  conveyor belts full of items.
- *Pets* are now (mostly) not stupid and have some additional features. There
  are also now even more creatures you can make your friends.
- *Villagers* are now a little smarter and have some new additions to trade with.

## FAQ
> ### What's with the name?
>
> Vanilla pudding is intented to still feel a bit like vanilla, but it isn't
> vanilla, it has extra stuff to it, the pudding. Combine the two, there you go
> Vanilla Pudding.

> ### Multiplayer?
>
> Yes! This pack started because I wanted something that my friends and I could
> just sit down and play. While it can totally be played singleplayer, I've
> included mods that lend themselves to multiplayer (Simple Voice Chat and 
> Create Numismatics).

## Known Issues
> ### Map Atlas doesn't show in recipe book
>
> Craft map of desired size, book, and slimeball or honey bottle together.
